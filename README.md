# Weather ETL and Power BI Comparison Project

This project builds a small end-to-end weather data pipeline that collects forecast data from the Open-Meteo API, stores it in MongoDB, loads it into PostgreSQL, reshapes the source CSV file, and creates a final comparison dataset for visualization in Power BI.

## Project workflow

The pipeline is organized into four Python scripts, each handling one stage of the process [file:444][file:445][file:446][file:447].

1. `01extractjson.py` fetches hourly weather forecast data from the Open-Meteo API and stores one document per forecast hour in MongoDB [file:444].
2. `02ETL.py` creates the PostgreSQL database if needed, loads records from MongoDB into PostgreSQL, and exports the PostgreSQL table to `raw_forecasts.csv` [file:445].
3. `03strucsv.py` cleans the raw Open-Meteo CSV file by extracting metadata and restructuring the hourly data into a flat CSV called `open-meteo-59.91N10.74E9m_cleaned.csv` [file:446].
4. `04final_merge.py` compares the PostgreSQL export and the cleaned CSV row by row, then writes the result to `final_weather_comparison.csv` [file:447].

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `01extractjson.py` | Extracts forecast JSON from Open-Meteo and inserts flattened records into MongoDB [file:444]. |
| `02ETL.py` | Moves weather data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and exports PostgreSQL data to CSV [file:445]. |
| `03strucsv.py` | Cleans and reshapes the raw Open-Meteo CSV source file [file:446]. |
| `04final_merge.py` | Produces a side-by-side comparison dataset for PostgreSQL and CSV values [file:447]. |

## Data flow

The data flow starts with the Open-Meteo API and ends in Power BI as a comparison report [file:444][file:445][file:446][file:447].

```text
Open-Meteo API
   -> MongoDB (raw_forecasts)
   -> PostgreSQL (raw_forecasts table)
   -> raw_forecasts.csv

Open-Meteo raw CSV
   -> open-meteo-59.91N10.74E9m_cleaned.csv

raw_forecasts.csv + cleaned CSV
   -> final_weather_comparison.csv
   -> Power BI dashboard
```

## Script details

### 1. Extract JSON to MongoDB

`01extractjson.py` sends a request to the Open-Meteo forecast API for hourly `temperature_2m` data, then stores the response in MongoDB as flattened hourly records instead of one nested JSON document [file:444]. Each stored document includes `forecast_time`, `temperature_2m`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `timezone`, and `ingested_at`, which makes downstream querying and loading easier [file:444].

### 2. ETL from MongoDB to PostgreSQL

`02ETL.py` checks whether the PostgreSQL database `weather_123` exists and creates it if necessary [file:445]. It then creates the `raw_forecasts` table, reads up to 72 documents from MongoDB, inserts them into PostgreSQL with `forecast_time` marked as unique, and exports the final table to `raw_forecasts.csv` [file:445].

### 3. Structure the source CSV

`03strucsv.py` reads the raw Open-Meteo CSV file, extracts metadata such as `latitude`, `longitude`, and `elevation`, then locates the actual hourly table starting at the `time` column header [file:446]. It splits the timestamp into separate `date` and `time` fields, standardizes the temperature column name to `temperature_2m`, adds location columns to every row, and saves the cleaned result to `open-meteo-59.91N10.74E9m_cleaned.csv` [file:446].

### 4. Final merge for comparison

`04final_merge.py` loads the PostgreSQL CSV export and the cleaned Open-Meteo CSV into pandas DataFrames, standardizes column names, and converts the date and time fields into matching formats [file:447]. It then renames the weather and location columns with `_psql` and `_csv` suffixes, adds row IDs so both datasets align row by row, merges them, and saves the output as `final_weather_comparison.csv` [file:447].

## Output datasets

The project creates three main CSV outputs [file:445][file:446][file:447].

- `raw_forecasts.csv`: Export of the PostgreSQL `raw_forecasts` table [file:445].
- `open-meteo-59.91N10.74E9m_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the raw Open-Meteo CSV file [file:446].
- `final_weather_comparison.csv`: Final side-by-side comparison dataset used in Power BI [file:447].

## Power BI report

The Power BI report uses the final comparison dataset to visualize PostgreSQL and CSV temperatures, compare trends across time, and calculate temperature difference measures such as `Temp Diff = [PSQL Temp] - [CSV Temp]` [file:448]. The report is designed to show whether the PostgreSQL-loaded data matches the structured CSV data row by row [file:447].

## Requirements

To run this project locally, the following tools and libraries are needed:

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017/` [file:444][file:445]
- PostgreSQL running locally on port `5432` [file:445]
- Python packages: `requests`, `pymongo`, `psycopg2`, and `pandas` [file:444][file:445][file:446][file:447]
- Power BI Desktop for the final dashboard

Install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install requests pymongo psycopg2 pandas
```

## How to run

Run the scripts in this order to reproduce the pipeline [file:444][file:445][file:446][file:447]:

```bash
python 01extractjson.py
python 02ETL.py
python 03strucsv.py
python 04final_merge.py
```

Then import `final_weather_comparison.csv` into Power BI to build the comparison report [file:447][file:448].

## Notes

The PostgreSQL load script limits the import to 72 MongoDB documents, so the comparison is based on that subset rather than the entire MongoDB collection [file:445]. The final merge aligns rows by generated `row_id`, which means the comparison is positional rather than based on a natural join key such as date-time equality [file:447].
